      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        At first I wasn’t sure where my passions would lead me, so I studied at the <strong>Fourth Foreign Language School Frederic Joliot Curie</strong>, a language-focused school where I learned French extensively.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interest in technology and interactive media has been with me since childhood, but I didn’t always know where it would take me. During those early years, I was still exploring my interests and figuring out what direction I wanted to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continued to grow, I realized that my passion for computers, creativity, and systems thinking pointed me toward game development, especially the technical and design aspects behind how games work and feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        That realization led me to <strong>Saxion University of Applied Sciences</strong>, where I’m now studying game design with a personal focus on simulation systems and user-centered experiences. My journey has taught me the value of exploring different paths, Iterating and testing before settling on a final decision.
