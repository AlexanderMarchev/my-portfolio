        <h2> High Caliber</h2>
        <p>
         
          A board game where players can take coins, buy bullets, and shoot others. Each shot has a probability of hitting based on bullets owned. Players scan unique characters for abilities, and the gun is an app that requires physical gyroscope-based shooting.

        <h2> Driving Simulation </h2>
        <p>
          A small simulation where I explored the creation of different vehicle physics, Researched the city of Cascais using Google Maps and Google Earth, then designed a track layout based on it. I also created different vehicles, all of which were available for the player to edit live in the game in levels 2,3,4. I also explored rain and particle systems and made the vehicles behave differently in different conditions. For the purposes of this prototype I didn’t do any UI/UX during the creation of this project        </p>

        <p>
          A game developed with the GXP Engine, where players control a slime navigating through challenging levels filled with obstacles. To reach the end of each level, players must cleverly interact with objects in the environment, such as boxes, teleporters, and levers, in order to open doors ,and make use of available paths.        </p>

        <h2> Celestial Clash</h2>
        <p>
          The objective was to develop a game using the GXP Engine that could also be played with a custom-built controller designed by our team. We created a boxing game where players dodge enemy attacks by lifting their feet off pressure plates and strike during the correct timing windows, using a separate single button controller to allow the players to punch they opponents.          <p><strong>Team Size:</strong> 6 | <strong>Duration:</strong> 2 weeks</p>

          The goal of the project was to create a point-and-click game. We developed a short interactive experience centered around puzzle-solving, enhanced by story elements that guided players through the gameplay.
